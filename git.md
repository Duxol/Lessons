# This is a basic git tutorial

## Creating a repository
You can create a repo in the GitHub website

It gives instructions on how to create the repo and how to clone it to your computer

## Initializing a repository
`git init`

## Cloning a repository
`git clone <repo url>`

## Getting the status of our repository
By checking the status we see how we changed our repo (what will be added/removed ..)

`git status`

## Pulling from a repository
It is used to sync our local host with GitHub (downloads changes from the web)
`git pull`

## Pushing to a repository
It is used to push our changes into GitHub

Add all files that have been changed (removed, renamed, added, modified)

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Comment"`

This last line pushes the changes to GitHub:

`git push`
